Documentation for the Automated Test Environment (ATE)
========================================================

Introduction
--------------

The Automated Test Environment (ATE) is a framework for automating production testing suitable for manufacturing and
industrial environments.  The ATE will assist the user in defining the tests clearly and concisely and will execute the
written tests in the same sequence over and over, saving the production data from each run as the test sequence
is executed.

Installation
--------------

For most, simply ``pip install ate`` should do the trick.  You may wish to stroll over to the
`github repository <https://github.com/slightlynybbled/ate>`_, clone it, and ``python setup.py install`` if you prefer.
